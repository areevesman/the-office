# Data visualization for _The Office_

Contains code and data to create a plot of the correlation between number of lines per episode and IMDb episode ratings for each character.

## Data 

Data comes from these two Kaggle datasets:
- [The Office IMDB Ratings Per Episode](https://www.kaggle.com/kapastor/the-office-imdb-ratings-per-episode)
- [The Office Script lines](https://www.kaggle.com/lillitarhea/the-office-script-lines)

## Plots

The code in [analysis.ipynb](/code/analysis.ipynb) generates the main part of this visualization:

Scatter plots of IMDb ratings vs. number of lines are also included for a visual assessment of the relationship between the two variables.
